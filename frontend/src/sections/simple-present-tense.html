<p>The simple present tense in English has few interpretations which depends on the context of the usage (Cowper, 1998).</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sartika (2020) defines present tense with four main uses, including a) <strong>repeated or regular actions in the present or habitual activity</strong>; b) <strong>reveal facts</strong>; c) <strong>express things that are always true</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cowper (1998) also provided some examples of the various usages of simple present tense, including:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Brigitta takes the train to work everyday. (habitual activities)</li>
    <li>Kelvin has short hair. (displays facts)</li>
    <li>That restaurant on the corner of the street sells a good pasta. (things that are always true)</li>
    <li>Dog has four legs. (displays facts)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="how-to-apply-simple-present-tense">How to apply simple present tense</h3>
<p>In the simple present tense, the root form of the verb is used, but an <em><strong>s</strong></em> or <em><strong>es</strong></em> is added to the verb when it is in the third-person singular form.</p>
<p>The grammatical sentences can be formed by applying the formula below:</p>
<p>I/You/We/They + verb + object</p>
<p class="font-semibold">Example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>I go to university every two days a week. </li>
    <li>You eat that bread deliciously.</li>
    <li>We normally drive to the lesson.</li>
    <li>They do not work in this building.</li>
</ul>
<p>He/She/It + verb(s/es) + object</p>
<p class="font-semibold">Example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>He goes to school by bike every morning.</li>
    <li>She normally opens the shop around 7.30 am in the morning. </li>
    <li>Look at that puppy over there, it sleeps on the sofa every evening.</li>
