### How to apply simple present tense

In the simple present tense, the root form of the verb is used, but an ***s*** or ***es*** is added to the verb when it is in the third-person singular form.

Easy way to remember this is by using this formula:

I/You/We/They + verb + object\
Example:
- I go to university every two days a week. 
- You eat that bread deliciously.
- We normally drive to the lesson.
- They do not work in this building.

He/She/It + verb(s/es) + object
- He goes to school by bike every morning.
- She normally opens the shop around 7.30 am in the morning. 
- Look at that puppy over there, it sleeps on the sofa every evening.
